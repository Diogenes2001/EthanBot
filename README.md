# EthanBot
A chatbot written in JavaScript that answers questions for me when I'm not there.

To run:

First make sure you have Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator installed: https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator
Go to the releases page and download and run the installer for your operating system.

Clone this repository, and run `npm start` in the terminal.

Open up Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator and click 'open bot'. Under bot URL, enter `http://localhost:3978/api/messages` and click 'Connect'

Enjoy!
...or invite me for an interview and I'll answer questions in person ;)
